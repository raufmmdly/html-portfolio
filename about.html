I’m passionate about technology and programming, with skills in C, C++, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.I enjoy solving complex problems through code and am always looking to learn new languages and technologies.After completing my bachelor’s degree, I plan to pursue a master’s to further deepen my knowledge in the field.
